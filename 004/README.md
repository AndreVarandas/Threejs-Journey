## Notes on 004

004 class was mainly about setting up a proper development environment. We use vite to run a dev server and to bundle our code. We also use vanilla JS and a script.js file to write our code.

**Key points**

-   Uses Vite
-   Uses vanilla JS, includes a `script.js` file and a notes.md

## Run it

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn

# Run dev server
yarn dev
```
