# Threejs Journey - Course Files

This is the repository for my notes and code for the [Threejs Journey](https://threejs-journey.xyz/) course by [Bruno Simon](https://bruno-simon.com/).

To run the code, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. You will also need to install dependencies with yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

Then, you can run the following command in the directory of the lesson you want to run:

```bash
npx parcel <lesson>/index.html
```
