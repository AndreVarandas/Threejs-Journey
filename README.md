# Threejs Journey - Course Files

This is the repository for my notes and code for the [Threejs Journey](https://threejs-journey.xyz/) course by [Bruno Simon](https://bruno-simon.com/).

To run the code, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. All the code is written in JavaScript and uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as a bundler.

## Run it

Cd into the folder you want to run, 000 is just the template, 001 is the first lesson, etc.
