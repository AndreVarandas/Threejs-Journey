## Notes on 001

This lesson is a simple introduction to the THREE.js library. It creates a scene, a camera, and a cube. It then renders the scene and camera to the screen.

**Key points**

-   The scene is the container for all objects in the scene.
-   The camera is the point of view of the scene.
-   The renderer is the object that renders the scene and camera to the screen.

## Run it

```bash
npx parcel 001/index.html
```
